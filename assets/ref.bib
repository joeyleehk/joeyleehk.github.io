  abstract = {This study proposes a deep learning model to predict short-term bike sharing usage through feature fusion in spatial and topological domains across two station-based bike-sharing systems in Chicago and New York. Based on the prediction results, the proposed model performs better than the baseline models. The results imply that the prediction model leveraging bike-sharing usageâ€™s spatial and topological features outperforms the model only using spatial features. },
